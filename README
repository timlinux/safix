What is this?

This is a simple application to repair the internal metadata for 
Tiff files provided by the Directorate of Geospatial Information, 
South Africa. Some of the data provided by them is stored 
in Tiff with 12bit JPEG compression but incorrectly reports 
that is is using 16bit compression in its metadata.

Running this program on such a file will correct that error.


Who wrote this?


This Program was kindly created by Frank Warmerdam. Here are the 
original notes he provided along with it:

"I poked around a bit but libtiff is a pretty fragile environment to
modify with hacks for particular bad data products.

However, I have come up with a small C program using libtiff that can
fix up one of your TIFF files labelled as 16bit when it is really 12bit.
I have attached it.  No exactly rocket science!

It should likely be used with a fairly recent version of libtiff like:

 http://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/tiff-4.0.0beta7.zip

Older system libtiff are likely to lack some important fixes related
to updating TIFF files in place - generally not a strength of libtiff.

The program will fix the file in place and then it should work with any
recent GDAL based application using the built-in libtiff/libjpeg libraries
as this will turn on 12bit support by default.

A command something like the following should be enough to build it.

 gcc -Ibld/include safix.c -o safix -Lbld/lib -ltiff

then just run it, one file at a time, on problem files to fix them.

The "fix" may very well break them for some other applications who
expect the problem behavior so be cautious about doing this to the original."
